## Task Description ##
Write a program to determine the maximum sum of an arithmetic series among a sequence of positive integers.
An arithmetic series is a sequence of numbers that any two adjacent numbers have the same difference.
For example, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 is an arithmetic series because any two adjacent numbers have the same difference of 2.
We can partition a sequence of positive integers into arithmetic series.
For example, if the sequence is (1,2,3,4,6,10,14), then there are three arithmetic series, which are (1,2,3,4), (4,6) and (6,10,14).
Now you need to find the arithmetic series with the maximum sum.
If there is more than one series with the maximum sum, report the one with more numbers in the series.
If there is more than one series with the same number of integers, choose the one with the largest first integer in the series.
Your output consists of the series sum, the number of integers, and the first integer in the series.

Note that you cannot use an array to store the input because of the large number of inputs in this problem.
## Input ##

The first line is the length of the sequence.
In the example 1, it will be 5.
The second line is the sequence of positive integers.
In the example 1, it will be 1 2 3 4 5.

All inputs and all arithmetics are in int.

## Output ##
Your output consists of the series sum, the number of integers, and the first integer in the series.
In the example 1 they are 15, 5, and 1.

In the example 2, (1,2,3,4) and (4,6) have equal sum.
The output is 10, 4, 1 because (1,2,3,4) has more numbers.

In the example 3, (1,5,9,13,17,21) and (6,8,10,12,14,16) have the equal maximum sum and numbers.
The output is 66, 6, 6 because (6,8,10,12,14,16) has largest first integer.
