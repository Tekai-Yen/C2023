## Problem Description ##
In the following order, we traverse an $N$ by $M$ matrix with integer $1$ to $N \times M$.
We traverse the elements of the topmost row from left to right and remove them.
We then traverse the elements of the leftmost column from top to bottom and remove them.
We repeat the two previous steps until we traverse all elements. 
For example, we will traverse a five-by-six matrix in the following order.

 $1$  $2$  $3$   $4$  $5$  $6$ 
  
 $7$  $11$  $12$  $13$  $14$  $15$
  
 $8$  $16$  $19$  $20$  $21$  $22$
  
 $9$  $17$  $23$ $25$  $26$  $27$
  
 $10$  $18$  $24$  $28$  $29$  $30$
 
 Now given $N$, $M$, and $k$, we want to find the row and column index of number $k$ in this $N$ by $M$ matrix.
 Note that the row and column index start from $1$.
 
 ## Input ##
 The first line contains 3 numbers, $N$, $M$, and $k$, representing the $N$ by $M$ matrix and the number $k$ in the matrix.
 All inputs and all arithmetics are in int.
 
 ## Output ##
 Output two numbers, which represent the row and column index of number $k$ in the matrix, respectively.
 
 ## Sample input ##
 ```
 5 6 20
 ```
 
 ## Sample output ##
```
3 4
```

## Estimated Cyclomatic Number ##
```
