<!-- Word Selection -->

## Task Description ##

Given a set of $N$ words of lowercase letters, find the subset that has all 26 letters and the minimum cost. For example, if you are given `abcdefghijklmnopqrst` with cost `3`, `rstuvwxyz` with cost `100`, `uvwxyzac` with cost `10`, and `abcdefghijklmnopq` with cost `1000`, then the answer is `13`. It is guaranteed that there will always be a set of solution that covers all 26 letters.

## Hint ##

You can use an array of length 26 to keep track of the number of times each letter appears within the subset you selected.

## Input Format ##

The first line in input is an integer $N$ indicating the number of words. For the following $N$ lines, each line contains a string and an integer indicating a word and its cost.

* $0 < N \leq 20$
* $0 < \textit{Word length} \leq 50$
* $0 < \textit{cost} < 2147483647 $
* $\textit{Sum of all costs} < 2147483647$

## Output Format ##

There is one line in the output. The line has an integer indicating the minimum cost.
