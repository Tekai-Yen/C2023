## Problem Description ##
Given a set of $n$ positive integers and another positive integer $K$, is there a way to pick a subset of size ** exactly ** $S$ from the set so that the sum of the numbers in the subset is ** exactly ** $K$? For example, the set is $\{1, 2, 3, 3, 2\}$, $K$ is $7$, $S$ is $3$, then the answer is yes, since we can find a subset ${2, 2, 3}$ whose sum of elements is $7$. However if $S$ is $2$ then we cannot find any solution.    

You need to implement the following function as described above.

```c
int subset(int numbers[], int n, int K, int S);
```

## Subtask ##
* 10pt. S is 2.
* 10pt. S is 3.
* 10pt. n is 4.
* 60pt. S is betwwen 4 and 7, and n is no more than 10.
* 10pt. S is betwwen 1 and n, and n is no more than 30.

## Hint ##
To solve the last subtask you need to notice that if the sum of the numbers you selected is already more than $K$, you should stop the recursion.

## Source codes ##
### main.c ###
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "subset.h"

int main() {
	int n, K, S;
	while (scanf("%d %d %d", &n, &K, &S) == 3) {
		int A[128];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
			scanf("%d", &A[i]);
		printf("%d\n", subset(A, n, K, S));
	}
	return 0;
}
```

### subset.h ###
```c
int subset(int numbers[], int n, int K, int S);
```

### subset.c ###
```c
#include "subset.h"

int subset(int numbers[], int n, int K, int S){
	// Fill your code in here.
}
```
