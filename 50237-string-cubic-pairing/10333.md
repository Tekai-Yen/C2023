## Task Description ##
There are $1^2 + 2^2 + ... + N^2 = N(N+1)(2N+1)/6$ cubics that stack as a tower. 
The tower has $N$ layers, and the $i$-th layer has $i^2$ cubics.
Each cubic has a string. 
A cubic is *exposed* if it does not have a cubic on top of it.
Now we start to find two exposed cubics with the same string $S$ and remove them.
This process will expose exactly two new cubics, and we will repeatedly remove any pair of exposed cubics with the same string $S$ until all exposed cubics have different strings.
For simplicity, we guarantee that at most *one* pair of exposed cubics will have the same string before and after removing the pair.
Please refer to the following illustration.

Note that you need to use a hash table to speed up the process of determining if the newly exposed cubics have the same string as any previously existing exposed cubics. In addition, you need to implement deletion in the hash table to prevent the number of elements in the table from exceeding the capacity $C$.

You may follow the hash function we provide or design your own hash function.

## Hash Function ##
We introduce a hash function $f$.
Let $s$ be a string of $L$ characters, and $s[i]$ be the i-th character of $s$.
We convert each character $s[i]$ to an integer $k[i]$, i.e., $a\rightarrow1,b\rightarrow2,...,z\rightarrow26$. 
$f(s) = (((k[0] \times 29 + k[1]) \times 29 + k[2])\times 29... + k[L-1])$ mod $K$, where $K$ is the size of the hash table, $C$ is the capacity of each index in the hash table.
You may set $K=N^2$ and $C=10$ in your program.

## Input ##
The first line contains $N$.
The following inputs are tower strings.
There are N sections representing N layers.
The first section has only 1 string.
The second section has 2 lines that each line has 2 strings.
.
.
.
Until section N, it has N lines with each line having N strings.
* $1 \leq N \leq 100$
* $1 \leq $string length $\leq 5$
* The string is composed of lowercase letters a, b, ..., z.

## Output ##

The output consists of the removed strings in order.
