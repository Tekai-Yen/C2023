## Task Description ##

We have a secret expression as a sequence of digits from 0 to 9.
To get the secret we replace 8 with '+', 9 with '\*', and 0 with '='.
For example, 1 2 8 2 4 9 3 0 means 12+24\*3=. 
Please write a program to compute the answer.
Note that we need to multiply first, then do the addition.

## Input Format ##

The input has one line of digits.
The number of digits might be huge, so you can not store them in an array.

## Output Format ##

The output has the result of the secret expression.

## Subtask ##
* 10 points: The secret expression has no operation.
* 30 points: The secret expression has only multiplications.
* 60 points: The secret expression has multiplications and additions.
