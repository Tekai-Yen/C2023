## Task Description ##

Write a program to print letters on a keyboard. 
We have the initial position of your finger. 
Your program needs to move your finger and type the letters.
There are six directions your finger can move. 
The direction 0 is right, direction 1 is top-right, direction 2 is top-left, direction 3 is left, direction 4 is bottom-left and direction 5 is bottom-right. 
Note that if your finger moves to a key that is not a letter, you ignore that move.
