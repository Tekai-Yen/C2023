## Task Description ##

Write a program to simulate Candy Crush.
Find three adjacent repeated numbers in a $r$ by $c$ matrix and change them to zeros.
For simplicity, your program only needs to find three repeated numbers in a row, in a column, or an L-shape pattern, and an integer will only appear at most three times in this matrix..

## Limits ##

Both $r$ and $c$ are no more than $500$.

## Input Format ##

The first line has $r$ and $c$. 
Each of the following $r$ lines has $c$ integers as a row in the matrix.

## Output Format ##

There are $r$ lines in the output.
Each of the $r$ lines has $c$ integers as a row in the matrix after setting adjacent repeated to zeros.
